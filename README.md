Luna is a one-of-a-kind backtesting framework built as a Live API, not just another backtest script or drag-and-drop tool.

Instead of forcing your strategies into rigid “bar-by-bar” loops or UI constraints, Luna replays historical data as if it were live market data, exposing a clean, event-driven API that feels like you’re talking to a real trading system:

Plug in your strategies as if they were running live

Receive ticks/quotes/orders via callback-style events

Simulate order routing, fills, latency, slippage, and fees

Swap between backtest, paper, and live with minimal code changes

Most existing backtesting software locks you into fixed assumptions about:

how data must be shaped,

how orders are handled,

which products/markets you can trade, or

how execution logic is modeled.

Luna is designed to remove those limitations by acting as a versatile backend API instead of a closed black box. You own the logic; Luna just gives you a fast, consistent, and realistic environment to run it in.

Use it to prototype, stress test, and evolve trading strategies while keeping the same structure you would use in production.
